//Intrinsic Time prediction

First, let's load stock data of a company from yahoo finance using pandas datareader:
//python
import pandas as pd
import pandas_datareader as pdr
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

symbol = 'AAPL'
start_date = '2016-01-01'
end_date = '2023-09-16'

df = pdr.get_data_yahoo(symbol, start=start_date, end=end_date)


Next, preprocess the data and transform it so that it can be ingested by the LSTM:

# Calculate the daily return
df['return'] = df['Adj Close'].pct_change()

# Remove the NaN at the head of our data.
df = df.dropna()

scaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0,1))
df['return'] = scaler.fit_transform(np.array(df['return']).reshape(-1,1))


Next, split the data into train and test datasets and construct the input for LSTM:

train_size = int(df.shape[0]*0.7)

x_train, y_train = [],[]
for i in range(60, train_size):
    x_train.append(df['return'][i-60:i])
    y_train.append(df['return'][i])

x_train, y_train = np.array(x_train), np.array(y_train)


Next, create and train LSTM models:

python
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(units=50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(x_train.shape[1], 1)))
model.add(LSTM(units=50))
model.add(Dense(1))

model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam')
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=1, batch_size=1, verbose=2)

# use the model to predict the prices of the test set
x_test = df['return'][train_size-60:]
y_test = df['return'][train_size:]

x_test = np.array(x_test)
x_test = np.reshape(x_test, (x_test.shape[1], 1, x_test.shape[1]))

predicted_price = model.predict(x_test)
predicted_price = scaler.inverse_transform(predicted_price)


Please, note that this is a very simplistic approach and there are several other aspects you might want to consider when trying to predict stock prices. Additionally, 
remember that this can't guarantee future results, and it's not advised to use this for actual stock trading.

Also, be aware that you will need the necessary libraries installed in your Python environment in order to run this script correctly. The key libraries include pandas, 
keras, sklearn, and pandas_datareader, installed via pip install pandas keras sklearn pandas_datareader.
