//We have data for the trading volumes and prices of different cryptocurrencies at different times. In this case, I assume we have a dictionary with the following structure for each currency: {time: (price, volume)}

//We need to calculate the product of volume and price at each time for each currency. This will give us a measure of the "importance" of the price at that time.

//Then we sum these products for each currency to get the total "weighted" price.

//We also sum all volumes for each currency to get a normalization factor.

//We divide the total "weighted" price by the total volume to get the volume-weighted average price.
