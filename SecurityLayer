// In the code provided above, we are adding HTTP Basic Auth as our authentication strategy. For each request, the client will need to provide a username and a password, which the server will verify against a dictionary of usernames and passwords.
//We are also using WTForms to validate incoming data as it offers an easy and flexible way to ensure the data we're getting from the user is safe to use.
//Remember to replace the users dictionary with a secure method of storing credentials, like a database with hashed and salted passwords. Users credentials are placed here just for the purpose of illustrating HTTP Basic Auth.
