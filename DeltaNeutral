//Handle API errors. Network issues or exchange problems can lead to API calls failing.

//Account for fees. Most exchanges have trading fees which can significantly affect your balance and should be accounted for in your calculations.

//Add logging. Make sure to log all actions, this helps in identifying how your bot is performing and diagnosing issues.

//Stream price updates. Instead of polling for prices, consider subscribing to the exchange's websocket feed for real-time price updates.

//Test extensively. Test your bot in various market situations. Start with paper trading and only switch to live trading when you are confident in your bot.

//Use stop losses. Crypto markets can be very volatile. Use stop losses to limit potential losses.

//Keep Code Secure. Your code will have API keys that give access to your funds. Ensure your keys are kept secure, ideally using a secure method of key storage, and limit the abilities of those keys where possible (e.g., withdrawal limits).

//Implement Risk Management. No matter how good an algorithm is, it should be included with a comprehensive risk management strategy. Every trade carries risk, so it should be managed according to your risk appetite.
